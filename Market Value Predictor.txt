Project’s Abstract:

Goal:
The goal of this project is to use machine learning techniques to predict the transfer market value1 and potential transfer fee2 of a soccer player based on their performance metrics  for the playing season and factors behind performance metrics such as age, position and other relevant features. 

1 Market value is an estimate of how much a soccer player is worth based on their skills, potential, and other factors.

2 Transfer fee represents the amount of money a seller club charges in exchange for allowing a player to transfer to a buyer club. Usually the market value is the least amount of money a seller club charges for a player.

What problems are we addressing?
The two problems we will be addressing are: Come up with a reproducible process, that can estimate the transfer market value of a player. Secondly, what would be a realistic amount that a seller club should charge(transfer fee) to the buyer club.

Description of problems we are addressing:
The soccer industry moves billions of dollars around the world in player transfers. Only last summer, English teams spent a total of €2.25 billion while Italian clubs spent €700 million and Spanish clubs spent 500 million in buying players. Most transfer market player valuations that are available to the public are crowd sourced. So the first problem that we are trying to solve is coming up with a model that estimates a player’s transfer market value based on match performances as well as crowd-sourced data. Our model would be based on a reproducible process, and not just based on the wisdom of a community.

The second problem that we are trying to solve is estimating the transfer fee- which is the actual fee the buyer club has to pay to the seller club. In the soccer industry, we often see that big English clubs have to pay an additional premium for buying a player, compared to if a small French team would want to buy the same player. Similarly, a player playing in the English Premier League  with a market value of €40 million, would be sold to another club in the same league for  €60 million because of the player already having an experience of playing in the league. However, the same player would be sold to a league in another country for a lesser amount. When determining the ultimate price tag for a player, selling clubs take into account various metrics, including the league where the buying club plays, the size of the buying club, and the level of urgency displayed by the buyer, all of which can impact the final transfer fee paid by the buying club.

Ultimately, we want to come up with a model that could estimate how the ultimate price tag(transfer fee) would differ for different soccer clubs.



Approach: 
Scrape data: 
Sofifa.com- Features: Player Ratings, Player Potentials
Sofifa contains all player ratings and their potential ratings from FIFA games developed by EA Sports. EA Sports update provides ratings to players based on crowdsourced reports from a community of over 6,000 FIFA Data Reviewers or Talent Scouts from all over the world are constantly providing suggestions and alterations to their database(https://www.goal.com/en-us/news/fifa-player-ratings-explained-how-are-the-card-number--stats-decided/1hszd2fgr7wgf1n2b2yjdpgynu). These ratings are updated everyweek, and Sofifa updates their database everyweek accordingly. The two features that we will be using from soFifa are player ratings and player Potentials.

TransferMarkt.com-  Features: Market Value, Remaining Contract Length, Age, Nationality, Club
Transfer market is a commonly used website by football enthusiasts to find player’s market valuations. On their website, transfermarkt state that they do not use an algorithm but instead relies on the wisdom of the community. However they state the the community relies on performance metrics such as goals scored, dribbles completed, trends of the market, demand/interest of the player and other factors: https://www.transfermarkt.co.in/transfermarkt-market-value-explained-how-is-it-determined-/view/news/385100

According to a report published in https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S037722172100895X, transferkarkt and other crowdsourced data has been found to be susceptible to bias. We will keep that in mind when presenting our findings.

WhoScored.com- Features: Match Ratings, Goals Scored, Assists, Clean Sheets, Dribbles completed, Number of Appearances and International Appearances.

WhoScored.com contains the real life plate’s performance metrics such as goals scored, assists and other features mentioned above. Because these numbers are based on player’s performances, it is not affected by bias.

Explore training data with tables and visuals 
Prepare the data for model training: We need to make sure that all of our data is in a format that allows us to perform quantitative analyses. We suspect that most of our data will consist of numbers, with a few notable exceptions like nationality or club. Nonetheless,  
Choose features. Our group members have some insight on what features may be useful for our purposes since they’re soccer fans. We would like for our model to be able to use as many useful features as possible, but understand that for convenience it would be ideal to manually subset features. Thereafter, we will try to use well-documented feature selection algorithms.  
Pick and fit an appropriate model
Examine the model's success on training data
Apply successful model on validation (test) data or pick new model if model is unsuccessful during training

Motivation and Question:

Our passion for soccer and our interest in the transfer market have motivated us to embark on this project. By leveraging the knowledge we have gained in our class and using performance data, we aim to develop a more accurate and systematic approach for estimating a player's value in the transfer market. We believe that such an approach, which is not solely based on the community's wisdom, could yield better valuations.

Moreover, unlike transfer market valuations, which are often seen as a minimum price, transfer fees are what clubs ultimately pay for acquiring a player. Thus, our project's focus on estimating the transfer fee is more applicable to the real-world context of the soccer industry.

Planned Deliverables:
“Full success.” What will your deliverable be if everything works out for you exactly as you plan?
The model will be able to predict future market values and the current market value of players as accurately as possible for a player based on different features scraped from the datasets.

“Partial success.” What useful deliverable will you be able to offer even if things don’t 100% work out? For example, maybe you aren’t able to get that webapp together, but you can still 
create a code repository that showcases the machine learning pipeline you need to use to support the app. Have a contingency plan!
If things don't work out 100%, instead of having a model that will predict future market values, then we will have a model that predicts the current market value.

Resources Required:
As of now, we have decided the sources for our training data for the most part. However, we have not decided on a specific source to get the data for players’ match performance which accounts for features listed in number 3 in the approach  section. We found a few free sources such as understat.com that we could use, but we don’t know about the data's accuracy and how it was collected. Alternatively, we have communicated with a few reliable sources where the data is not behind a paywall; however, accessing the data requires their authorization. We are waiting to hear back from these sources.
