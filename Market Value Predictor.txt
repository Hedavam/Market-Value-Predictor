Project’s Abstract:


* We are trying to find a machine learning approach to estimate the future transfer market value (according to  of a soccer player .
* 

1. Transfer Market: A market where clubs can sell and buy players for a certain price. 


* Success: Able to accurately predict market values. Auditing for biases in the transfer market and in our model.

* Approach: 
* Scrape data from Sofifa
* Explore training data with tables and visuals
* Prepare the data for model training 
* Choose features 
* Pick and fit an appropriate model
* Examine the model's success on training data
* Apply successful model on validation (test) data or pick new model if model is unsuccessful during training
* Bias Findings




“Full success.” What will your deliverable be if everything works out for you exactly as you plan?
* The model will be able to predict future market values and the current market value of players as accurately as possible for a player based on different features scraped from the datasets.


“Partial success.” What useful deliverable will you be able to offer even if things don’t 100% work out? For example, maybe you aren’t able to get that webapp together, but you can still create a code repository that showcases the machine learning pipeline you need to use to support the app. Have a contingency plan!
* If things don't work out 100%, instead of having a model that will predict future market values, then we will have a model that predicts the current market value.
