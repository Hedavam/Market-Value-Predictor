Project’s Abstract:

Goal: We are trying to find a machine learning approach that estimates the future transfer market value (according to https://www.transfermarkt.us) of a soccer player.1

Transfer Market: A market where clubs can sell and buy players for a certain price. 

Success: Able to accurately predict market values. Auditing for biases in the transfer market and in our model. 


Approach: 
Scrape data:
 Sofifa.com- Features: Player Ratings, Player Potentials
Sofifa contains all player ratings and their potential ratings from FIFA games developed by EA Sports. EA Sports update provides ratings to players based on crowdsourced reports from a community of over 6,000 FIFA Data Reviewers or Talent Scouts from all over the world are constantly providing suggestions and alterations to their database(https://www.goal.com/en-us/news/fifa-player-ratings-explained-how-are-the-card-number--stats-decided/1hszd2fgr7wgf1n2b2yjdpgynu). These ratings are updated everyweek, and Sofifa updates their database everyweek accordingly. The two features that we will be using from soFifa are player ratings and player Potentials.

TransferMarkt.com-  Features: Market Value, Remaining Contract Length, Age, Nationality, Club
Transfer market is a commonly used website by football enthusiasts to find player’s market valuations. On their website, transfermarkt state that they do not use an algorithm but instead relies on the wisdom of the community. However they state the the community relies on performance metrics such as goals scored, dribbles completed, trends of the market, demand/interest of the player and other factors: https://www.transfermarkt.co.in/transfermarkt-market-value-explained-how-is-it-determined-/view/news/385100

According to a report published in https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S037722172100895X, transferkarkt and other crowdsourced data has been found to be susceptible to bias. We will keep that in mind when presenting our findings.

WhoScored.com- Features: Match Ratings, Goals Scored, Assists, Clean Sheets, Dribbles completed, Number of Appearances and International Appearances.

WhoScored.com contains the real life plate’s performance metrics such as goals scored, assists and other features mentioned above. Because these numbers are based on player’s performances, it is not affected by bias.

Prepare the data for model training: We need to make sure that all of our data is in a format that allows us to perform quantitative analyses. We suspect that most of our data will consist of numbers, with a few notable exceptions like nationality or club. Nonetheless,  //Hedavam
Choose features. Our group members have some insight on what features may be useful for our purposes since they’re soccer fans. We would like for our model to be able to use as many useful features as possible, but understand that for convenience it would be ideal to manually subset features. Thereafter, we will try to use well-documented feature selection algorithms.   //Hedavam + An

“Full success.” What will your deliverable be if everything works out for you exactly as you plan?
The model will be able to predict future market values and the current market value of players as accurately as possible for a player based on different features scraped from the datasets.

“Partial success.” What useful deliverable will you be able to offer even if things don’t 100% work out? For example, maybe you aren’t able to get that webapp together, but you can still 
create a code repository that showcases the machine learning pipeline you need to use to support the app. Have a contingency plan!
If things don't work out 100%, instead of having a model that will predict future market values, then we will have a model that predicts the current market value.
